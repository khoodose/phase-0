## Reflections on 1.1. Think About Time

I’ve learned about habit building techniques, the use of meditation, different kinds of mindsets and mentalities toward learning, getting in the zone and using specific time management strategies like time boxing and the pomodoro technique.

Good time management is enabled by good habit building.Starting with tiny habits is better so you don't rely solely on sustaining motivation and willpower.  Using positive reinforcement when you do something good can help cement habits.  Counterintuitively, we might start with extrinsic rewards to build a habit and eventually it becomes something intrinsic.  Because just building up a good inner motivation is not easy.  The notion of “attitude first then behaviour” may actually inhibit good habit formation.  Faking it till you make it is just as useful for habit building.

(Fun fact: Ramit Sethi and I lived in the same sophomore year dorm.  Clearly Ramit has managed time and built habits far far better than I have…)

I haven’t tried meditation before and I’m looking forward to learning more about it.  Based on the material, it looks like a good way to help you focus, especially when you’re faced with information overload.

I really agree with the growth vs fixed mindset thing too.  I’ve seen it happen with many intelligent people I know who are afraid to take on new things because their sense of self worth is tied to past achievements or because they think everyone’s potential is fixed.  There are even friends who worry about whether folks can learn enough from coding bootcamps and after to become competent programmers, versus say recent college graduates in CS.  It’s important to believe you can grow.

Things like the pomodoro technique and time boxing can help with time management and productivity.  I feel like sometimes we inevitably end up with extended versions of the pomodoro technique as we charge toward impending deadlines and take breaks.  There are diminishing marginal returns from pushing it too far when you’re fatigued.  I often get up and pace around after I’ve completed a certain chunk of work, even when I’m feeling good about what I’ve completed.  So I guess I informally pomodoro it sometimes.

Time boxing feels a little familiar, like something out of group project management, where tasks are broken down and assigned set timings.  When we time box, we have the advantage of checking in on progress once the time is up rather than letting things drag until tasks are completed.  I think we can use time boxing in Phase 0 (and beyond really) in terms of breaking down large tasks into smaller tasks that are time boxed.  This can help limit the amount of time we spend struggling with something difficult before we take a break or get help.

These tiny habits and techniques are really important when we’re not quite “feeling it”.  This is linked to flow or being in the zone, which is something I’ve experienced while churning out work on something I know fairly well.  I think in college this happened with writing English essays when I was done making notes on the readings and forming a thesis in my mind.

I currently do time management better when working in a team.  We usually have a Gantt chart or shared calendar notification of sorts.  Some past workplaces have also used tools like Asana.  On my own, I use milestones in the near future to mark down when I need to get work done.  I find the near-term milestones easier to focus on.  I am most successful with this when the projects are things I’m interested in.

I think I will indeed try out the Pomodoro technique (with my phone timer) to be a little more systematic and disciplined about things.  This will be my little tactic.  For my broader strategy, I will mark out times on my weekly calendar at the start of the week (time boxing) so I know exactly when I’ll be working on Phase 0 stuff.  Each week I will review based on how it went the previous week in terms of time of day I did the assignments as well as whether I over or under budgeted.

And, last but not least, after I use the restroom in the morning, I will do 15 pushups. :p


## Reflections on 1.2 The Command Line

**1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

A shell is a command line interpreter like the terminal on the Mac
Bash is the default type of shell on operating systems like OSX.

**2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

Coming to grips with some of the new terminology and commands.  I probably won't remember all of it right away.  Also, while I have some sense of how the GUI links to the CLI, I am still more comfortable with the GUI.

**3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Yes, but remembering or stringing them all together is another thing

**4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

I think at the very least, basic navigation commands like the following would be useful:
ls to list files so we can search for them
cd to navigate
mv and rm to move and remove files

**5.  Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**

-pwd -> print working directory
-ls -> list contents of this directory, ls -lR to show every darn thing below it
-mv -> move (rename) a file
-cd -> change directory, can be used with cd .. an cd../../.. to navigate further up the tree… cd takes you back to home directory
-../ -> up one level
-touch -> create a new empty file
-mkdir -> make a new directory
-less -> open and view files.  will display by page.
-rmdir -> remove directory
-rm -> remove a file
-help -> get details on commands


## Reflections on 1.4 Forking and Cloning


**If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?**

**Create a new repo:**

    *Go to your GitHub account
    *Find the “+” icon in the top right corner
    *Click and select new repository


**Fork a repo:**

    *Find the Fork symbol in the top right corner below the “+”
    *Click on it
    *If you only have one github account / are only logged in to one, congratulations, you’ve successfully forked the repo
    *If you have more than one account, then click on the account you wish to fork to


**Clone a repo:**

    *On the right side of the repo’s GitHub page, find the “HTTPS clone URL” box
    *Select and highlight the entire URL, then copy it
    *Open up your terminal and using command line, navigate to the folder you wish to clone to
    *Type “git clone “ and paste in the URL you copied.
    *Voila.


**What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?**

Remembering where the icons are.  Also there’s the whole list of git commands to remember.  Practice makes perfect, I guess?  I know there are other challenges ahead like conflicts between branches (don’t know how to resolve that).
