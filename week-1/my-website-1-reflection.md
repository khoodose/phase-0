**Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**

**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

- Go to github.com
- Sign in or create an account if you don't have one
- Now in the top right corner of the page, you should see a "+" icon, that you can click on.  Select new repository
- You'll have to enter a few options, including naming the repository, initializing it with a readme, making it public (if you so choose) and adding an MIT license.
- After clicking create repository, on the next page you should be able to find the HTTPS clone URL.  Select all of it and copy it.

- Now open up your terminal (cmd space and type terminal for Mac OSX)
- Navigate to the directory where you would like to clone the repository (use cd "directory-name")
- Once there, type "git clone " and paste the repository url and hit enter.  Your repository will now be cloned from GitHub to your computer.

**Describe what open source means.**

Open source makes the source code for a program available to anyone for viewing and customizing.  Often programs made this way are free as a social mission or as a means of building up a following and developer community.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I think it's given us great resources and is a good channel for people to contribute and collaborate (or get started doing so).  It does have some disruptive aspect to business models along the lines of "information wants to be free".  I guess not everything can be open source.  Attempts at utopia throughout human history have generally led to dystopia over time.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Licenses grant specific permissions to others to use the code / content.  They allow creators to retain copyright.  They facilitate collaboration by allowing others to make contributions more easily.  The MIT License is apparently the least restrictive one (didn't know that until reading up) and lets you do anything as long as distribution is accompanied by the license.  Have been a little better acquainted with Creative Commons in the past.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

Managed to get more practice with the git add / commit / push / merge process so I can do most of it without looking at the notes.  Already have some familiarity with HTML but I'm sure aha moments there coming soon.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

Err not yet but I'll keep looking?
