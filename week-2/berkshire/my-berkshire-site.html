      - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

      Pretty good.  It was easier to figure out some things like making lists and adding links.

      - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

      Still a work in progress.  I know the article and section stuff etc. is still out there.  I know being semantic is important but I guess the importance of this will really become clearer as we go along and build more complex sites and have more than one person working on them.

      - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

      Alright.  I guess it helps that the assignment picked Berkshire’s site and not some really formatting-rich one.  Looking forward to CSS in Week 3.

      - What seems good and bad about HTML?

      Good: Easy to markup.  Tree and nesting give it a good structure.

      Bad: Div and table hell.  Could use some help from CSS pronto :)

      - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

      - Practice, I guess?  It’s kind of like the command line and Git.  Finger and brain muscle memory.
