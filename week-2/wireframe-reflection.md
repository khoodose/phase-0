**What is a wireframe?**

- It's a mockup or sketch of what a website will look like.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

- It helps us with designing, to get our thoughts out
- It's a visual aid for the whole team of different roles to come together, discuss and agree
- It is like a draft of the site for us to reference and edit as we go along

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

- It was alright I guess.  The software (Balsamiq) was pretty user friendly.  I liked the sitemap software from the previous exercise even more though.


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

- I sketched some ideas out on paper but I already had a basic sense of say what I wanted the blog to look like so it's basically like my first idea.  Looking forward to thinking about this more and getting inspiration from the class and the resources.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

- It was ok.  Honestly the main question I asked was "I hope the relative path for the image works this time, 'cos last time after I had to shift folders it didn't and I ended up doing an absolute path.  Haha."

- The resources given were pretty comprehensive.  References to designs and tools available for wireframing.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

- Tedious... nothing in particular.

- Interesting: I enjoyed the design talk, which I watched just before the wireframing.  Helped me think about font colors and layout.  Didn't get to necessarily use the knowledge that much but made me appreciate the design process better.
