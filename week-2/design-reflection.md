**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

They are:

- information gathering
- planning
- design
- development
- testing and delivery
- maintenance


**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

- To introduce myself, showcase my (future) dev work, and engage with the community at large through blogging

- It will have links to my social media presence and perhaps a portfolio of work (github?)


**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

- Fellow developers and business people in the tech industry may be interested to see if others have encountered similar technical challenges.  I hope to share my experience and insights from discussions I have with peers and seniors.


**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

- I think contacting me and seeing my portfolio would be the preferred primary actions.


**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

- user centered design (this reminds me of student-centered lesson design in my past life as a teacher)

- while there are UX designers with great domain expertise, most people now who work with the web will need to know about UX.  This is especially relevant for startups, where resources may be tight.

- since UX is not one size fits all, we can design for specific scenarios / experience and encourage behaviors but we can't cater to everyone out there

- while UX is important, it's not easy to measure its success using traditional metrics

- there is some uncertainty, even if budgets are ample, over where specialized UX designers fit in the workflow

- UX designers test current state, conduct A/B testing (ooh), survey users, make wireframes and prototypes, develope profiles and personas and design user flow.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

- user experience design considers

- the more complicated things get, the more UX design is important so that users get to experience functionality seamlessly.  Otherwise users have a bad experience and sites may lose customers and revenue.

- we also need to think about people accessing the same resource through multiple devices so the same content could have a different UX


**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

- it was generally alright.  I enjoyed working on the sitemap and liked the tool.  The UX reading was a little long.
